This comprehensive regulatory data scraping engine represents a sophisticated solution for monitoring and analyzing utility regulations across the United States. The system combines traditional web scraping techniques with cutting-edge AI technologies to provide real-time insights into regulatory changes.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Data Collection
- **Multi-source Integration**: Monitors 500+ regulatory websites across all 50 states
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Uses both BeautifulSoup and Selenium for JavaScript-heavy sites
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Implements hierarchical token bucket algorithms to respect server limits
- **Proxy Rotation**: AWS-based proxy infrastructure ensures reliable access

### AI-Powered Processing
- **Document Classification**: Custom NLP models categorize documents by type and relevance
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies key regulatory entities, dates, and compliance requirements
- **Semantic Search**: Vector embeddings enable intelligent content discovery
- **Quality Assessment**: ML models validate document completeness and accuracy

### Real-time Analytics
- **Change Detection**: Monitors regulatory updates in real-time
- **Impact Analysis**: Assesses potential business impact of regulatory changes
- **Compliance Tracking**: Maintains compliance calendars and deadlines
- **Automated Alerts**: Notifies stakeholders of critical regulatory updates

## Technical Implementation

The architecture follows a microservices pattern with:
- **Scraping Layer**: Distributed scrapers with fault tolerance
- **Processing Pipeline**: Kafka-based streaming for real-time processing
- **AI Services**: Containerized ML models for scalable inference
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Elasticsearch for search
- **API Gateway**: RESTful APIs with GraphQL for complex queries

## Impact and Results

- **500+ sources** monitored continuously
- **99.5% uptime** with automatic failover
- **10,000+ documents** processed daily
- **25% improvement** in compliance accuracy
- **50ms average** response time for searches
